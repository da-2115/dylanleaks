### Lesson 13 - Intro to inverse functions

#### Notes

- An inverse function is the inverse of a function such that (in a normal function) the output will be a value in the range of the function which is mapped to a value from the domain of the function, the an inverse function is **reverse**, a value in the range is mapped to a value in the domain.
- An inverse function is represented by a function to the power of $-1$ e.g. $f^{-1}(x)$
- To solve a function for it's inverse simply solve for $x$ instead of $y$ e.g. $f(x)$, for example say I have the function $f(x) = 2x + 4$, the inverse of the function is just solving for x, so the inverse is: $f^{-1}(x) =\dfrac{x}{2} - 2$
- To solve an inverse function's value from a table e.g.:

| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| --- | ------ |
| 5   | 6      |
| 10  | 11     |
| 14  | 13     |
| 16  | 12     |
Simply swap them around e.g.:

$f(x) = 6$
$f^{-1}(x) = 5$
