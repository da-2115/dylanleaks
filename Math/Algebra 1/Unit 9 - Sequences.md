### Lesson 1 - Intro to arithmetic sequences

#### Notes
- An arithmetic sequence is simply an ordered list of numbers.
- You can have finite and infinite sequences, e.g. $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$ and $\{2, 4, 6, 8,\dots\}$
- Sequences can be written like the following (say I have an arithmetic sequence that starts from 2 and increases by 5, 4 times):

$\{a_k\}_{k=1}^4=\{2,7,12,17\}$

- Or in function notation:

$a(k) = 2+5(k-1)$
#### Questions
Q1) What is next in the arithmetic sequence $\{3, 9, 15, 21,\dots\}$?

Q2) What is the 4th value in the arithmetic sequence $a(n) = 4+5(n-1)$?

Q3) What is the 5th value in the arithmetic sequence $\begin{cases}a(3) = 5\\a(n)=a(n-1)+16\end{cases}$ ?
