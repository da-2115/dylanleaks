Oscar (nickle) has said the following:
- There are tools which can be ran on a host computer such as CUDA Toolkit for L4T,
- Jetpack is a bunch of graphics / ai related packages preconfigured for the development of the Jetson.,
- Jetpack offers the ability to install Jetson Linux on the Jetson which is the only distribution that supports the Jetson hardware,

Now, we are not 100% on this still, so what I proposed to Oscar and will talk to you tomorrow about all, is whether we pause this for now like Filip and I discussed but start the research phase of this now to get an idea of what the definitive requirements are.

What we think is correct (Oscar and I):
- Jetpack's tools CAN be ran in a docker container.,
- Jetpack proper should be installed on the Jetson,
- We can pursue Jetson in docker, but only the tools, the proper Jetpack setup should be performed on a Jetson running Jetson Linux.

We are looking at creating a research task by the 31st July, then doing Jetpack in the next sprint.
All my team members (I'm still not sure about Matt.M) have access to Notion, just need Filip to possibly approve it. Have also got people signing up to GitHub, Jack, Oscar and I have access.
