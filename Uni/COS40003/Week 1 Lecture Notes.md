### Notes
- Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm to support concurrent computing
- Computing paradigms include:
	- Concurrent computing
	- Parallel computing
	- Distributed computing
	- Cluster computing
	- Grid computing
	- Cloud computing
	- Fog/edge computing
- Concurrent computing - is where (from the **observer's** PoV) where computing tasks are done simultaneously. 
- Parallel computing - is where (from the **system's** PoV) where computing tasks are done simultaneously.
- Concurrent computing was developed on a single processor, but can also apply to multiple processors.
- Concurrent computing uses time sharing to schedule computing tasks; i.e. how to improve response time while ensuring fairness.
- Concurrent computing also uses concurrency control mechanisms against race conditions, deadlocks.
- Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.
- In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down into several, often many, very similar subtasks that can be processed independently. 
- Distributed computing does not have a single definition but has commonly agreed properties:
	- There are several autonomous computers, each of which has its own local memory
	- The computers communicate with each other via message passing
- Rough way to classify concurrent systems as parallel or distributed:
	- In parallel computing, all processors have access to shared memory to exchange information between processes.
	- In distributed computing, each process has it's own private (distributed) memory by passing messages between the processors.
- An example of parallel computing is a multi core CPU or GPU.
- Distributed computing examples include:
	- Cluster computing
	- Grid computing
- Cluster computing is when multiple computers of low-cost are connected via a fast LAN to provide high-performance computing power (but not always)
