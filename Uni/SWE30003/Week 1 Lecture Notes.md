### Notes
- Software Development Activities
	- Requirements Elicitation - Establish the needs of the customer
	- Requirements Analysis - Model and specify the requirements ("what")
	- Design - Model and specify a solution ("how")
	- Implementation - Construct a solution in software
	- Testing - Verify the solution against the requirements
	- Maintenance - Repair defects/bugs and adapt the solution to new requirements
- SWE30003 (Software Architecture and Design) focuses on Activities 2-4 (Requirements Analysis, Design & Implementation).
- Why do we build Software Systems?
	- To keep/retain customers
	- To increase customer base
	- To improve customer relationships
	- To improve productivity/efficiency (within the team/organisation)
	- Technology currently in use no longer support/outdated
	- Changes in environment (legal, social)
- Categories of Business Goals - Business goals fall into five broad categories (addresses some pain points)
	- Reduce cost of ownership: development, maintenance, deployment, operation
	- Improve the quality of the system(s) compared with it's predecessors with respect to performance, modifiability, security, reliability, etc.
	- Improve the functionality/capabilities of the system compared to it's predecessor.
	- Improve organisation's market position.
	- Improve external confidence in the organisation or the system.
	- NOTE: A particular system generally has more than one goal.
- Many systems involve a variety of different stakeholders
	- Customers
	- Developers
	- Users
	- Managers
- All of the stakeholders may have different views and priorities.
- Different views and priorities can leading to conflicting goals.
- Development approaches must be able to cater for different views and priorities.
- The priority of goals needs to be specified
	- Some goals are "nice to have" some you "need to have", some are "absolutely critical"
	- Developers sometimes have to "push back" or have trade offs. Knowing priorities gives insights.
- Source of goals also needs to be specified
	- Some goals are inherent to the system being developed.
	- Some goals are a result of market analysis.
	- Some goals are arbitrary in the sense that they can cause problems.
- Functional and non-functional requirements
	- Functional requirements - describe system services or functions, for example:
		- Compute sales tax on a purchase
		- Update the database on the server
		- Basically, **anything that can be directly expressed as code**
	- Non-functional requirements (quality requirements is another name for this), for example:
		- Reducing the cost of deployment cannot be directly expressed as code
	- Domain requirements - stem from the application domain of a system
		- May be functional or non-functional
- Non-functional requirements
	- Product Requirements - Specify that the delivered product must BEHAVE in a certain why (e.g. speed, reliability, etc)
	- Organisational requirements - follows of organisational policy (e.g. process standards used)
	- External requirements - Arise from factors which are external to the system and it's development process (e.g. interoperability requirements, legislative requirements, etc.)
- Verification - Are we building the product right?
	- Does it conform to the specification(s)?
- Validation - Are we building the right product?
	- Does it meet the stakeholder's expectations?
- Requirements Verifiability
	- Requirements must be written so they can be validated and objectively verified.
	- Imprecise
		- "The system should be **easy to use** by experienced controllers and should be organised in such a way that **user errors are minimised**"
		- The two terms in bold are useless as specifications as they are too vague.
	- Verifiable
		- "Experienced controllers should be able to use all the system functions after a total of 2 hours training. After this training, the average number of errors made by experienced users should not exceed two per day"
- Software Design
	- Design vs Design
		- Design is the creative process of transforming the problem into a solution.
		- The design of a system determines a set of components and inter-component interfaces that satisfy a specified set of requirements.
	- The Process of Decomposition
		- Decomposition is a process that helps manage the complexity of a software system
		- Starts with a high-level overview of the system
		- Creating the low-level details of the features of the system in turn
		- Stop when we are satisfied with the level of detail.
		- Also known as **Divide and Conquer**
- Models
	-  A model is a simplification of reality
	-  Models are created for better understanding of the problem, the domain or the system to built.
	- A model can capture and represent
		- Structure (static model)
		- Behaviour (dynamic model)
		- Examples of a model:
			- Architectural blueprint of a house
			- Hand-drawn UI screen/wire frame
			- UML class diagram
- Quality-Driven Design
	- Quality Requirements are those that drive the structural design of a software system.
	- Leads to questions, such as:
		- How are the quality requirements
			- Specified?
			- Validated?
			- Achieved?
		- and how can understanding the impact of quality attributes be used during the design process?
